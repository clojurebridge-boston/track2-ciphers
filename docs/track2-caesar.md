# Caesar cipher

## Letter shift 
*Relevant functions:* [+](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/%2B), [-](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/-), [mod](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/mod)

Caesar cipher works by shifting the alphabet by a given number of positions to the left, wrapping around at the end. 
The key for the cipher is how many positions the letters are shifted by. 
For instance, if the key is 3 then `a` is replaced by `d`, `b` by `e`, etc. Here is the shift of the entire alphabet:
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc
```

In order to write a function `shift` that shifts a letter
by a given number, we need to:

1. Convert the letter to an integer number using `to-int` function.
2. Add n to it.
3. Take the result modulo 26 (that would allow us to wrap around). For instance, if the letter is `x` (position 23 in the alphabet, where `a` is 0), and the shift is 3, the result would be 23 + 3 = 26. The largest letter is `z`, at the position 25, so 26 should result in 0. Taking the result modulo 26 accomplishes this task. 
4. After computing the position, we need to convert it back to a character by applying the `to-char` function that you wrote earlier. 

The function that performs modulo arithmetic is `mod`. Here are a few examples of how it works:
```clojure
(mod 7 26) ; result: 7
(mod 27 26) ; result: 1
(mod 55 26) ; result: 3
(mod -5 26) ; result: 21
```

**Exercise:** Write a function `shift` according to the description above. Some examples for how it should work:
```clojure
(shift \a 3) ; result \d
(shift \b 20) ; result \v
(shift \z 3) ; result \c
```
Note: if you shift by a negative number, you are performing a reverse operation. For instance, `(shift \d -3)` gives you `\a`. Thus decryption is just using the same function, but with the opposite (negative) key.  

## Working with words: sequences, `map`, `mapv`
*Relevant functions:* [map](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/map), [mapv](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/mapv)

Now you can "encrypt" a letter, but you probably want to encrypt words. If you were writing a program in python or Java, you probably would be thinking of writing a loop. However, in Clojure we use *higher-order functions* that traverse sequences for us, and we just need to specify what operation we would like to perform on each element. 

`map` and `mapv` are such higher-order functions. They take in a sequence of elements and a function, and return a sequence that results from applying the given function to each element.  

This sounds very abstract, so let's look at an example with `mapv`. We use a function `inc` (increment) that takes an integer and returns the next integer, i.e. `(inc 1)` returns 2. now we are going to increment each element of a sequence of numbers
using `mapv`:
```clojure
(mapv inc [1 3 2]) ; returns [2 4 3]
```
Here `[1 3 2]` and `[2 4 3]` are *vectors* of numbers. This is the easiest way of giving Clojure a collection of elements in a specific order. What you get back is a vector in which each element of the given vector is incremented by 1. 

The difference between `map` and `mapv` is that they return the result in a slightly different way: `map` returns a sequence in its most general form, and `mapv` returns its result as a particular sequential collection known as a *vector*. Vectors are slightly easier to work with for our examples, so we are using `mapv`. 

**Exercise:** What do you expect when you type in Clojure REPL?
```clojure
(mapv to-int [\a \b \c])
``` 
Try it, see if the result is what you were expecting. If it's not, make sure to understand what it is and why. 

Note that you can also apply `mapv` to a string:
```clojure
(mapv to-int "abc")
``` 
The result is a vector of numbers. 

**Exercise:** Copy the following definition of the function 
`square` into the definitions panel of Nightcode (right upper panel): 
```clojure
(defn square
  "Takes a number and returns its square"
  [x]
  (* x x))
```
Reload the file. Now in the REPL panel **type in** an expression, **using `mapv`**, that computes the squares of numbers `[1 3 -2]`.

### Using anonymous functions
Maps are often used together with anonymous functions. These
are one-time-use functions that are put together "on the fly" and not given a name. they also don't given names to their parameters, referring to them as `%1, %2, %3` - or just `%` if there is only one. 

They are often used with higher-order functions, such as `mapv`. Here is an example:
```clojure
(mapv #(* % %) [1 3 -2])
``` 
This returns `[1 9 4]` (the vector of squares of all given numbers, just like in the exercise above). 
The anonymous function passed to the `map` is `#(* % %)`. It is equivalent to the `square` function above. The `%` sign here refers to the parameter of the function, it is used instead of `x`. The `#` in front of the expression indicates that this is a function. 
      
**Exercise:** Use `mapv` and an anonymous function to take the opposite of each number in a given vector. For instance, if the vector is `[2 -1 0 3]`, the result would be `[-2 1 0 -3]`.

### Converting from vectors to strings
`mapv` returns its result as a vector, but it would be really useful to get it as a string. The conversion is non-obvious, and you can skip the explanations of how it works. Here is the code for it: 
```clojure
(apply str [\w \o \r \d]) ; results in a string "word"
```

**Explanations of `apply` (you can skip this):**
Here is the [clojuredocs description of `apply`](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/apply) The function takes a vector and passes individual elements of it to a function, as if they were written separately, and not in a vector. For instance, `(+ [1 2 3])` is an error since `[1 2 3]` is a vector, and `+` doesn't work on vectors. What we want is `(+ 1 2 3)`, that's a valid summation and results in `6`. Using 
`(apply + [1 2 3])` works exactly like this: it passes the three arguments to `+` individually, and not as a vector. 

Now we are done with the nitty-gritty details for our ciphers, and are ready to do some encryption and decryption.

### Encrypting with Caesar cipher

Now we can encrypt words with Caesar cipher. Let's say we want to encrypt the word "apple" by shifting the alphabet by 20. We need to do the following steps:

1. use `mapv` to shift each letter in the sequence by 20 positions; we can write the actual shifting as an anonymous function that uses the function `shift` that we wrote earlier.
2. use `apply str` to convert the result from a sequence to a string. 

Feel free to write this out on paper or in Nightcode before you look at the solution below. 

```clojure 
(def s (mapv #(shift % 20) "apple")) ; encrypt the sequence
(def result (apply str s)) ; convert to a string
```
The result, `"ujjfy"`, is the encryption of "apple" with the key `20`. 

Instead of saving intermediate results in variables, you can
also write all the steps in one line of code:
```clojure 
(apply str (mapv #(shift % 20) "apple"))
```
The latter style is more common in Clojure.

Of course, we want to encrypt different words, not just "apple", and use keys other than `20`. Thus, we want to write 
a function that takes a word and a number `k`, and shifts the word by `k`. Here `k` serves as a key for the cipher. 

**Exercise** Below is the start of a function that encrypts 
a word `w` with a key `k`. Fill in the body of the function and test it on some examples. 
```clojure 
(defn caesar-encrypt
  "encrypting a word w with a key k using Caesar cipher"
  [w k]
                                     ) 
```
Don't forget to 
write all functions in the right upper panel of Nightcode, save and reload file, and test the function in the REPL. 

Make sure that `(caesar-encrypt "apple" 20)` 
returns the same result as the expression that you wrote 
earlier, and that passing different words (all lower-case letters, no spaces) and different keys gives you different encryptions. 

## Decrypting with Caesar cipher
Encryption is good only if we can later decrypt the text. 

**Exercise** Based on the function `caesar-encrypt`, write a
function `caesar-decrypt` that takes an encrypted word (all lower-case, no spaces or other symbols) and a key and returns 
its decryption. Recall how we can use the same `shift` function for decryption. 

Test that `(caesar-decrypt "ujjfy" 20)` returns `"apple"`.
Then try your decryption on the following:

- `(caesar-decrypt "gtxyts" 5)`
- `(caesar-decrypt "mvytebolbsnqo" 10)` 

**Exercise** Encrypt your own examples and post them on slack (with the key), then try to decrypt other participants' examples posted there. Before you post your own, make sure they decrypt correctly. 

## Working with strings that have other symbols

Encryption is not particularly helpful if it preserves capitalization, punctuation, spaces between the words, and similar things that reveal a lot about the text. Thus, in order to encrypt text we will remove all the symbols other than letters and will convert all letters to lowercase. 

### Converting to lowercase: calling a Java function.
*Relevant Java functions:* [Java toLowerCase string method](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#toLowerCase--) (note that Java functions are commonly refer to as methods). 

One of the advantages of using Clojure is that one can use all available Java functions and libraries directly from Clojure. For instance, we can use Java `toLowerCase` method of the `String` class to convert a string into all lowercase letters. 

The syntax for using a Java method on an object is to put the method name into the prefix position (just like any Clojure function) and to precede its name with a dot: 
```clojure
(.toLowerCase "What is Clojure?") ; results in "what is clojure?"
``` 
Feel free to play with other Java methods for strings: 
[Java 8 String methods](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html).  

### Removing non-letter symbols
*Relevant functions on clojuredocs:* [filter](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/filter), [filterv](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/filterv), [odd?](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/odd_q)
<br />
*Relevant Java functions:* [isLetter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html#isLetter-char-)

Now we are going to use another Clojure higher-level function, `filterv`, to remove all the non-letter character from a string.  It takes a function that returns a true/false value and a vector, and returns a new vector with only those elements of the given one for which the function returned a true value. 

For example, we can use a function `odd?` that works as follows: `odd? 5` returns `true`, `odd? 4` returns `false`. 
If we want to keep only odd integers from a given sequence, 
we can use `filterv` with `odd?`:
```clojure
filterv odd? [6 7 -1 0 5]) ; results in [7 -1 5]
```

Note that `filterv` is a vector analog of a more common (but less convenient in our case) function `filter`, just like `mapv` is a vector analog of `map`.

Just like `mapv`, `filterv` can also take an anonymous function:
```clojure
(filterv #(< % 5) [3 6 5 8 0]) ; results in [3 0]
```
The anonymous function `#(< % 5)` returns true if its argument is strictly less than `5` and false otherwise. 

We will be using a Java method of the Character class `isLetter` to check if a character is a letter. There is a slight difference in how this method is defined in Java: it's method not attached to any object, just to the Character class (it's a so-called static method), and so the syntax for calling it is a bit different:
```clojure
(Character/isLetter \a) ; true
(Character/isLetter \?) ; false
```

**Exercise:** write a function `get-letters` that takes a string with any symbols in it, and returns a string of of 
only letters in it, all letters converted to lowercase, as in the example below: 
```clojure
(get-letters "Hello, friend!") ; "hellofriend"
``` 
The sequences of steps that the function needs to perform is:

1. Convert the string to lowercase letters using `toLowerCase` (note: this function works on a string)
2. filter out non-letter characters using `filterv`
3. Convert the result back to a string using `apply str`. 

You might want to first try out the steps in REPL, and then put it all together in a function.  

## Encrypting and decrypting text with Caesar cipher
Now you are ready to do encryption and decryption with Caesar cipher on entire strings of text. The result would be all lowercase with no punctuation marks, but still readable.

The sequence of steps for encryption would require you to:

1. Use `get-letters` to get a string only letters (in lower case) from the text that you are trying to encrypt. 
2. Encrypt this string using your `caesar-encrypt` function.

As a test example, `"Hello, friend!"` with the key 5 encrypts to `"mjqqtkwnjsi"`. 

Decryption doesn't require filtering out other symbols and converting to lowercase since encrypted strings are already of the right format, so you can use your `caesar-decrypt` function. 

Try decrypting the following: 

**TO-DO**: add

## What's next?  
Encryption and decryption is easy to do if you know the key (the amount of alphabet shift). But what do you do if you don't know it? The next section shows you how you can break Caesar cipher without a key using Clojure hashmaps.
